# LocalRepoProjectMycomputer
This is a new repo created for a teamwork project and i am on this project from the get go so no reason for cloning 
so this a brand new project that i would be sharing my changes to the codes with my team just by pushing all my 
changes to the remote repo or on github for them to validate.
